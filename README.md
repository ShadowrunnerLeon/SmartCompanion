Work in progress. At the moment I am adding support for OpenCV Ð² C++. The project is being built, but it hangs at 75% when the engine starts. There is a working image processing code in the "Script" folder. If you want to test the project, you need to comment out "preProcess" and "postProcess" in ComputerVisionModule.cpp and use "system" instead of these functions in "Run" with the path to the script "yolov8.py".
